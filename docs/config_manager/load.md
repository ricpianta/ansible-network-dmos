# Load configuration into device
The `config_manager/load` function provides a means to load a configuration file onto a
target device running Datacom DmOS. The `config_manager/load` function provides configuration
values that allow the source configuration to either be merged with the
current active configuration (default) or to replace the current active
configuration on the device.  


## How to load a configuration
Loading a configuration onto a target device is fairly simple and
straightforward. By default, the `config_manager/load` function will merge the
contents of the provided configuration file with the configuration running on
the target device.  

Below is an example of how to call the `config_manager/load` function.

```
- hosts: dmos
  
  roles:
    - name: ansible-network.datacom_dmos
      function: config_manager/load
      config_file: dmos.cfg
```

The example playbook above will simple load the contents of `dmos.cfg` onto the
target network devices.

### How to load and replace a configuration
The `config_manager/load` function also provides support for replacing the current
configuration on a device.

In order to replace the configuration, the function as before but adds the
value `replace: yes` to the playbook to indicate that the configuration should
be replace.

Note: Take caution when doing configuration replace that you do not
inadvertantly replace your access to the device.

```
- hosts: dmos

  roles:
    - name: ansible-network.datacom_dmos
      function: config_manager/load
      config_file: dmos.cfg
      replace: yes
```

## Arguments

### dmos_config_replace

This value enables or disables the configuration replace feature of the
function. In order to use `dmos_config_replace` the target device must
support config replace function.

The default value is `False`

#### Aliases

### dmos_config_file

This required value provides the path to the configuration file to load when
the function is called. The path to the file can either be provided as

### dmos_config_remove_temp_files
